Description:

Develop a program to find the maximum height which it can reach. Hint: Maximum height, h=u2 /2g.

Explanation:

Assume acceleration due to gravity is 9.8m2 /sec. Assume an object is thrown upwards with some initial velocity, u (in m/sec).

 int main()
 {
 int a;
 scanf("%d", &a);
 printf("%.2f", (a*a)/(2*9.8));
 return 0;

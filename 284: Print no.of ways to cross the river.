Description:

You are crossing a river without getting wet by jumping on the rocks in the path. You can skip atmost 1 rock while jumping.
There are N rocks in the path. Write a program to print no.of ways to cross the river.

Input:
First and only line contains an integer N no.of rocks in the path.

Output:
Your program should print no.of unique ways to cross the river.

Sample Input1:
3

Sample Output1:
3

Explanation:
You can cross 3 ways when there are 3 rocks in the path
1) First jump on to first rock and second jump on to second rock and thrid jump on to third rock and then other side of river (1, 2, 3).
2) First jump on to first rock and second jump on to thrid rock(since you can skip 1 rock, skipping rock no.2) and then other side of river (1, 3).
3) First jump on to second rock and second jump on to third rock and then other side of river (2, 3).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100

Sample Input	
5

Sample Output
8


#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int arr[100]={-1};


int fabi(int n){
    arr[0]=0;
    arr[1]=1;
    for(int i=2;i<=n+1;i++){
        arr[i]=arr[i-1]+arr[i-2];
    }
    return arr[n+1];
}

int main(){
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    
    cout<<fabi(n);
}

Develop a program to find the Maximum from a set of elements. The number of elements will be decided during the execution of the program.

Sample Inputs	
3 52 89 99	

Sample Outputs
The Largest of 3 numbers is 99


 //Please accept the inputs from the console and print the output
 #include <stdio.h>
 
 int main()
 {
     int n, l=0;
     scanf("%d",&n);
     int arr[n];
     
     for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
     {
         scanf("%d",&arr[i]);
         if(l<arr[i]){
             l=arr[i];
         }
     }

     printf("The Largest of %d numbers is %d", n,l);
     return 0;
 }

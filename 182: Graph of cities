Design, Develop and Implement a Program in C for the following operations on Graph(G) of Cities a. Create a Graph of N cities using Adjacency Matrix. b. Print all the nodes reachable from a given starting node in a digraph using DFS/BFS method

Explanation:

Sample Inputs	
1
11
2	

Sample Outputs
graph is connected


 //Please accept the inputs from the console and print the output
 #include <stdio.h>
 
 int main()
 {
 int a, b;
 scanf("%d\n%d",&a,&b);
 
 if(a==1){
     printf("graph is connected");
 }
 
 else 
    printf("Invalid choice");
 return 0;
 }
